# Documentation Updates Summary

## What Changed

All planning documents have been updated to reflect the clarified project goals and implementation strategy.

---

## Key Clarifications

### API Clients
**Purpose:** Production code used throughout the application
- Every sync, check, or verification operation uses these clients
- No more direct API calls anywhere in the codebase
- Type-safe, validated, reliable foundation

### MCP Servers
**Purpose:** Interactive interface for Claude Code
- **ALL** API operations exposed as tools (1:1 mapping)
- Enable real-time operations: archive mentors, check numbers, verify logic
- Docker-hosted for simple deployment
- Complete access to both APIs

---

- docker-compose.yml for orchestration
- Environment variable management
- Claude Code configuration via docker exec
- Management commands (logs, restart, rebuild)
- Troubleshooting guide

### 5. README.md

**Status:** Still accurate - no changes needed

The README ties all documents together and remains the entry point.

## Example Use Cases (After Implementation)

### With Claude Code + MCP Servers

**"Archive mentor John Doe"**
```
Claude Code:
1. get_all_contacts()
2. Search for "John Doe"
3. archive_contact(id)
Result: "Archived John Doe (ID: 98765)"
```

**"How many mentors fully fundraised?"**
```
Claude Code:
1. get_campaign_by_code("mentor-2025")
2. get_all_campaign_members(campaignId)
3. Filter where raised >= goal
Result: "23 of 45 mentors (51%) fully fundraised"
```

**"Did john@example.com submit the mentor form?"**
```
Claude Code:
1. get_forms()
2. get_all_form_submissions(formId)
3. Search for email
Result: "Yes, submitted 2025-10-20 (ID: 6234567890123456789)"
```
