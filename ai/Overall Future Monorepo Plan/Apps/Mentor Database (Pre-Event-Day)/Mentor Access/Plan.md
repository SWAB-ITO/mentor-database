# Mentor Access Portal

**Route:** `/mentor` (public-facing, auth-gated)
**Users:** UGA student mentors (1,000 annually)
**Purpose:** Self-service portal for mentors to access their information and event details

---

## Status

**üöß Not Yet Implemented** - This is a planned interface

---

## Purpose

The Mentor Access portal provides a **self-service interface** for mentors to:
1. View their personal information and fundraising progress
2. Access Event Day details and their assigned partner
3. Update contact information
4. Access training resources and event materials
5. Communicate with SWAB staff (future)

**Key Distinction from Exec Interface:**
- **Read-only** for most data (mentors cannot edit core data)
- **Limited write access** (can update phone, email, preferences)
- **No admin functions** (no sync, no global view, no override)
- **Public-facing** (requires authentication)

---

## Authentication & Access

### Login Methods
**Option 1: Email-based (Passwordless)**
- Enter UGA or personal email

- Session persists for 30 days

**Option 2: Phone-based (SMS)**
- Enter phone number (same as check-in)
- Receive SMS code
- Enter code to authenticate
- Session persists for 30 days

**Recommendation:** Email-based (more secure, less SMS cost)

### Supabase Auth Integration
- **Auth Channel:** `mentor` (separate from admin)
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):**
  - Mentors can only view/edit their own record
  - `WHERE mentor.uga_email = auth.user.email` or `phone = auth.user.phone`
- **Session management:** JWT tokens

### Registration/Onboarding

## Security Considerations

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
**Enable RLS on `mentors` table:**
```sql
-- Mentors can only see their own record
CREATE POLICY mentor_view_own
ON mentors FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR uga_email = auth.email());

-- Mentors can only update specific fields
CREATE POLICY mentor_update_own
ON mentors FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR uga_email = auth.email())
WITH CHECK (
  -- Only allow updating these fields
  personal_email IS NOT NULL AND
  phone IS NOT NULL AND
  shirt_size IS NOT NULL
);
```

### Data Privacy
- **Hide sensitive data:**
  - Don't show other mentors' personal info (except partner)
  - Don't show financial details beyond own fundraising
  - Don't show admin notes or internal tracking
- **Audit logging:** Track profile updates

---

## UI/UX Specifications

### Design

### Phase 4:
