**Specifications for all 10 new components**

**Composite Components:**
1. StatusBadge - Unified status indicators
2. ConsoleOutput - Terminal-style output display
3. StatCard - Metric display cards
4. Checklist - Visual checklists with progress
5. StatusCard - System status display
6. FormSelector - Enhanced form selection with search

### 🎯 [PRINCIPLES.md](./PRINCIPLES.md)
**Core design philosophy**

**The 5 Pillars of Simplicity:**
1. Clarity over cleverness
2. Progressive disclosure
3. Obvious next steps
4. Instant feedback
5. Error prevention over error handling

### 📋 [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
**Phased implementation strategy**

**5 Phases:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (design tokens, extend Badge)
- Phase 2: Core Composites (StatusBadge, ConsoleOutput, StatCard)
- Phase 3: Advanced Composites (Checklist, StatusCard, FormSelector, FileUpload)
- Phase 4: Feature Components & Refactoring (ConfigWizard, page refactors)
