> This entire dir will soon be the entire detailed plan for this app & monorepo but for now, I am going to focus on building out the structure in the dir trees, using smart folder layounts to guide the rest of my thought capture. This will be deeply embedded with AI and as such, we need to aoid creating long and fanciful things that are difficult to edit and change when we change the scope. I want to prefer clear and established steps over dumped information and that needs to be noted throughout this entire process. We will be defining different app interfaces that will run for different purposes (8 total but more on that later...) with all of the features and the architecutre very clear and understandable.
