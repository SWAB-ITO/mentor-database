# Initial Communication Campaign

**Date:** October 12, 2025

**Status:** Planning

**Channels:** Text & Email

## Campaign Goals & Context Dump
> Note: This campaign will be delivered via both text and emai. The text will be one final injected text per mentor, regardless of what custom injection was within the text. We will upload it as one custom filed and send texts to mentorsusing just that field to prevent further complication. Email however will have the seperated parts. I will put the sections into the email that are global then have a field injection for the one piece that changes per mentor. I believe there are currently 2 fields around custom messages...maybe we can rename them to one for email which is just the custom part the other of which is the full curated message

### Envisioned Flow of Communication

- Hi {{mentor name}} SWAB is happening November 9th & we are excited for Event Day!  
- This is where we will deviate and have different options depending on mentor status:
    - Page created, fully fundraised, ready for mentor trainings!
    - Page created, not fundraised $75 yet, only final task before trainings is to fundraise.
    - GB setup form filled out, page not found on givebutter. Use your {{mentor_personal_email}} email, select Mentors 2025 as your team, set your goal to $75, and click this link to create a fundraising page (https://givebutter.com/SWABUGA2025/join).
    - Check this email {{mentor_personal_email}} for a "Next Steps..." email from SWAB wil a link to setup your fundraising page.
- The next step, mentor training sessions will be October 20th, 21st, and 28th and mentors must sign up & attend a session where we will hand out your shirts, mentor train, and prep you for Event Day (we do not care which one. if you cant go to the one you signed up for but you can go to another last minute, just come and do not worry about the sign up)
- Info about partners & group creation will come out after mentor sign ups close this Friday, Oct 17. If you have any friends you want to partner or group with, make sure to tell them to sign up before the deadline!
- Other than that, all you have to do is pay attention to our emails & texts over the next month leading up to Event Day. Thank you and contact info@swabuga.org with any questions.

## Target Audience & Stylistic Goals: All mentors that have signed up before we create this message
- The goal for the final message is for it to be very clear, neutral tone with common terms that are effortlessly intuitive and make mentors feel "wow, that makes sense no need to worry"
- We want to use as few words as possible without being confusing or robotic
    - Complete and optimal clarity is the end state goal

## Execution Idea
- We can execute by first using this context as a starting point, edit the current state to reflect both the email and text nature of the execution, change any errors caused by renaming the parent folder to comms and removing the campaign middle one
- The thought is to then create a draft version that is the exact things we are planning to say that we will co-create then finalize in this md file lower, then add info on the implementation of the messages into the import database before we prep the csv for contact import & gb syncing
    - we can ensure that the template, tools, readme, etc all respect and understand our full goals here to ensure we leave with a good product
