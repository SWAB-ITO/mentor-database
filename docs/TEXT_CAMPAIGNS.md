**Fix:**
```bash
npm run text:validate
# Review errors and warnings
# Fix data in Supabase if needed

**Fix:**
- Verify field names in Givebutter match CSV column headers exactly

---

### Issue: Contacts not filtering correctly

### Issue: Duplicate contacts created

**Cause:** Givebutter couldn't match by name+email/phone

**Fix:**
